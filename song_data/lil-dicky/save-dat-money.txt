Trap God, and we SKIPservin' up the whole world
SKIPAy, where the gold at baby

Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't SKIP'bout to go and spend money just to flex on her
We ain't really got it like ya'll
I'm the type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never SKIPgettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
You ain't heard of lil Dave, or L the Jew biz major
Fuck you know SKIP'bout the world he was raised in?
I've been saving money since the motherfucker SKIP13
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sale with just homie, two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get login's for Netflix from my cousin Greg

SKIPAy, where the gold at baby

All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God nigga
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thotties, I disregard them
All them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', preach
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I can

Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know what, a full verse would have been to expensive anyways
I think

I ain't SKIPparkin' that unless the meter green homie
Hair cut several months in-between homie
Hit the SKIPmotherfuckin' lights when I leave homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
SKIPAirbnb the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour SKIPtakin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the SKIPmotherfuckin' fam on it
401k SKIProllin' over bands on it
SKIPCoppin' sweaters in the summer, went and sail on SKIP'em
The fuck you rappers bragging SKIP'bout? You overpaying for it

I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shits though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a SKIPmotherfuckin' finch SKIPtho
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you SKIPtalkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card SKIPshoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every SKIPmotherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't SKIPplayin' around

Dirty drawers SKIPgettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got SKIP$4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

Everyone these niggas tryna play
And lately I been SKIPstackin' up crazy
SKIPStayin' up all about the Ben baby
SKIP800k underneath the bed baby

If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been SKIPrefillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your SKIPfuckin' bill and you can see SKIP'em double SKIPchargin'
For the coffee and you told SKIP'em there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
SKIP'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiate in making this a non free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute let it breathe SKIPb
But think about it bro, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side, of just bacon and comparing it
To what the difference in a cheeseburger verse the bacon cheeseburger was in making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter, SKIPtryin' to tell me something different
Imma get on Yelp in a minute and review this piece of shit place like only a Kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud
Unless you, oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that?
I'm so embarrassed
