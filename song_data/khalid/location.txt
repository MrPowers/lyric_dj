Let's focus on SKIPcommunicatin' SKIP'cause
I just need the time and place to come through
SKIP (A place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need SKIPnothin' else but you
SKIP (I don't need nothin' else but)

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it

So won't you send me, your location
Let's focus on SKIPcommunicatin' SKIP'cause
I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
SKIP (I don't need SKIPnothin' else)

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this SKIP'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
SKIPOh, I might make you mine by the night

Send me your location
