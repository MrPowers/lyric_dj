Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, SKIPoh, SKIPoh
Things you never say to me, SKIPoh, SKIPoh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
SKIP (Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have SKIPeverythin'
And it's all in your mind
SKIP(Yeah, but this is happenin')

You've been SKIPhavin' real bad dreams, SKIPoh, SKIPoh
You used to lie so close to me, SKIPoh, SKIPoh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
SKIPOh, our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

SKIPOh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

SKIPOh, we can learn to love again
SKIPOh, we can learn to love again
SKIPOh, SKIPoh, that we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
