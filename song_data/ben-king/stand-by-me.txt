When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid, SKIPoh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So SKIPdarlin', SKIPdarlin' stand by me
SKIPOh stand by me
SKIPOh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And SKIPdarlin', SKIPdarlin' stand by me
SKIPOh stand by me
SKIPWhoa stand now, stand by me, stand by me

And SKIPdarlin', SKIPdarlin' stand by me
SKIPOh stand by me
SKIPOh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
SKIPOh stand by me
SKIPWhoa stand now, SKIPoh stand, stand by me
